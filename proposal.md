# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Stock market analyz

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

We are going to do something similar to the stonks project on canvas. It will focus on downloading stock data and visualizing trends.  
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This is a stock market analyzer, it will look at past stock prices and see their trends over time. We will extract the data from Yahoo Finance and users are able to look at these stocks and look at the details surrounding it. The project will show the price of the stock, 20 and 50 day average prices, and the changes in the stock and how much the price of the stock goes up and down. It is helpful for users as they can understand the risk aspect behind purchasing a specific stock. We will also have a buy and sell aspect of it, which alerts users when it is the best time to buy and sell their stocks. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Chandrahas Rachamadugu: tus23882@temple.edu, Xinwen Zhang
Yesha Shah: tut18744@temple.edu, Daniel Blitshtein

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Look at how much the stock prices go up and down.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Add a buy and sell feature with the stocks, notifying users the best time to buy and sell their stocks.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Include a graph of the stocks, some sort of image. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We first will need to look into the instructions on canvas for the stonks project to see how to best utilize those instructions. I will work on writing code for calculating reutnrs, volatility, and the buy/sell signals. Chandrahas will work on setting up the stock data. Yesha will work on creating the charts. We will all make sure to review each others work and put it together to work cohesively. We will learn how to use the pandas data, matplotlin, and yfinance for stock data. I also overall need to learn more about the stock market in general.
