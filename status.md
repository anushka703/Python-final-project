Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far we have mainly created the code to show the stock data, created a graph showing the stock trends, and created an option for users to buy and sell stocks.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We still need to code an option for users to view the 20 and 50 day averages and show the risk of the investments. We would do this by showing how much the stock is going up or down.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We are having problems with the graph, it won't change with the stock market. Additionally, we are having problems with syncing the stock market data with the code.
